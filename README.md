# external-notification-service

The External Notification Service provides a mechanism for us to send notifications to customer systems by means of a WebHook. Initially these notifications will be when new ADDS Pipeline Data and FTP Replacement Data becomes available. Longer term, the external notification service is intended to be an enterprise service, easily extended to other notification types.
